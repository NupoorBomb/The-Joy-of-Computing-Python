#You are provided with the number of rows (R) and columns (C). Your task is to generate the matrix having R rows and C columns such that all the numbers are in increasing order starting from 1 in row wise manner.
#Input Format:
#The first line contain two numbers R and C separated by a space.
#Output Format:
#Print the elements of the matrix with each row in a new line and elements of each row are separated by a space.
#NOTE: There should not be any space after the last element of each row and no new line after the last row.

#Example:
#Input:
#3 3
#Output:
#1 2 3
#4 5 6
#7 8 9

a=[int(n) for n in input().split()] # e.g. a = [2,4]

matrix = [[i*a[1]+j+1 for j in range(a[1])] for i in range(a[0])]
for m in matrix:
    print(*m)
